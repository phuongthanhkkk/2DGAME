## üìñ About The Game

### Introduction
The Land of Fantasy is the name of our game. For those who have never played a Quest Hunter game, RPG 2D is a monster-slaying treasure search role-playing game.
<p> Players will have access to and control over the captain, the game's main character, as they search a mythical realm for the true treasure. Players must do certain common activities like fighting monsters to level up and gathering gold to buy helpful tools along the route. The game is also created with 4 levels of varying difficulty. The player must proceed and solve puzzles to unlock the levels until finally being able to defeat all the enemies and discovering the wealth.
<p> This game's environment will resemble the true topography of a mysterious land of legend and is a 2D pixel game. Since players will be exploring a lot of new space while playing this game, they will be able to do a virtual campus tour. Each level, in particular, will feature terrains with various difficulties, such as islands, caves, volcanoes, and air, giving players the chance to reach an impassable location because of objectivity and originality. The answer to this problem will be this game.
